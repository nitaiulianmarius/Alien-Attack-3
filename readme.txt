To compile Alien Attack 3 you need to download and install Unity. Also you can enjoy the game downloading it from github release folder https://github.com/nitaiulianmarius. To install it on your Android Phone, make sure you enabled "install software from unknown sources" option

I used unity game engine to create a 2d game where you destroy asteroids with a spaceship. The game runs on android phones and uses the phoneâ€™s gyroscope to move the spaceship and touch for the attack.
Technologies: C++, Unity2D, Android
